#+TITLE: Video Description (Template)
#+AUTHOR: Tony aldon

* About
The section /scenes/ of this document is a template of how I write
Inside Emacs videos:
  - A /scene/ starts with ~** scene 0: scene name~.
  - A /description/ starts with ~# description~, the paragraph
    following it is the description.  I must be followed by a least
    one empty line.
  - So far, everything else doesn't matter.
* scenes
